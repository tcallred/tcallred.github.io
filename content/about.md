# Hello world!

My name is Taylor Allred and I am a software developer and programming language enthusiast. 
I grew up in Vermont and then moved to Utah to do a Bachelors in Computer Science at Brigham Young University and then a Masters in CS at the University of Utah.  
I'm currently living in Salt Lake City. 
I am a husband and father to two boys. 
I love building delightful applications, thinking about code design, playing video games, and listening to Japanese City Pop. 

# Areas of Interest
## Frontend Development (UI/UX)
One of my biggest passions is UI/UX. 
There are few things better than a snappy, delightful interface that lets a user immerse themselves in the software seamlessly. 
There are also few things worse than a slow, clunky, confusing interface that leaves the user resentful and bitter. 

My dad and I have a mutual love of good design that lands at the intersection of artistic creativity and mathematical precision. 
We used to come up with novel interfaces and ask questions like "what if it was like this". 
I remember when the iPhone first came out and we both stared jaw agape at a video demonstrating it's smooth, elegant interactions. 

To me, a good user interface is a like a good game. 
It gives you parameters to work within and then a small number of clear interactions that you can compose together. 
It should be productive, but it should also have an element of fun.  

## Programming languages
Languages (natural, spoken ones) have always fascinated me. It's amazing how it's easier to express an idea in some languages than others. 
Ever since I started out as a programmer, I was intrigued that there were different languages to choose from and that they had different use-cases. 
I wanted to learn as many as I could, just for the fun of it! 

I remember one day looking in the school library for books on programming, hoping to find a language I hadn't learned yet. 
I picked up a book on C# excitedly but after reading a few pages realized "Oh. This is just Java." 
Disappointed, I determined that I had probably learned all there was to know about programming languages and that they were all only slight variations on one another. 
That is, until I happened upon Bruce Tate's *Seven Languages in Seven Weeks*.
I knew this book was a winner the moment I thumbed through it. It was a sampler platter of seven *completely* different languages that I had never heard of, and I ate it all up. 
This book opened my mind to the world of programming paradigms and convinced me that a language could be designed to make programming better. 
What started off as an interest became an obsession and I have been reading about, thinking about, and keeping up-to-date with programming languages ever since.
